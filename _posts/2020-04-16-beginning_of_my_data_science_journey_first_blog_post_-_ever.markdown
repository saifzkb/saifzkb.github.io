The first 4 days of my Data Science bootcamp have been an extremely immersive experience. My instructor, Rafael Carrasco has been amazing and makes the sessions very interactive and fun. As per him no one way is right, there are multiple ways of doing the same thing and you decide what you want to do, i strongly agree. He is really enthusiastic for everyone to ask as many questions as possible and has shown us many ways to ask questions.
On the third day it felt like i was taking in too much information to keep up, but now after getting to practice that day's lesson i feel much more comfortable about it. I am really excited to where this journey takes me. But for now i want to enjoy learning everyday much more than the previous day. A challenge to my self in this journey would be to practice more than i did the previous day. 
Why i chose data science? - There are multiple reasons, but let me talk about two. First one was that i was really looking forward to creating something of my own which will be used by a vast majority of the coding community. I want to contribute towards the betterment and more efficient ways to do one thing(Not that it is not efficient enough already).
Also i was looking toward learning to developing a prediction algorithm for stocks that aim to predict the daily adjusted closing prices using data from the previous N days. By using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) metrics,  the lower the value, the better the prediction. I am 'sciched' for using the scikit-learn library in python for regression and clustering.
Given prior experience with SQL server, i am quite excited to see and test installing the pyodbc package. I love working with data and looking forward to using MongoDB as well if it is included in the syllabus this time. Overall there are extreme positive vibes i feel from my fellow Cohorts and i'm sure this journey will be a fun one.
